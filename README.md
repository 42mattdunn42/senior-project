# Dice Tavern - Senior Project

## Project Description
Dice Tavern is a card and dice roguelike game made in the Unity Game Engine. 
The player traverses through a gauntlet of different enemies until they are able to defeat them all. 
In Dice Tavern, dice rolls are a core mechanic that affects outgoing damage while cards have the ability to produce unique effects to change the state of the game. 
To succeed, the player must combine card effects to both manipulate dice rolls and produce different synergistic effects. Meanwhile, the enemy AI will also use cards to produce unique and difficult challenges for the player to overcome. 
With the dice damage system based loosely on poker and Yahtzee rules, there is a lot to master and experience while playing Dice Tavern.
